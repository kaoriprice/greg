						My art making effort closely follows the design elements of shape-to-form and line. Cutting shapes from flat sheets of metal while visualizing the form that could be hammered from these shapes starts this effort (shape-to-form). The raising technique is perfect for making pure handmade form, my vessel are this.
					</p>
					<p class="techniques__paragraph techniques__item">
						Added to this pure form is the use of line, also cut from flat sheet. Hammering the cut flat sheet of metal from a ribbon shape to a tight fine line (and the many variations in between) is this effort... The hammered line...
					</p>
					<p class="techniques__paragraph techniques__item">
						Combining of these elements to make compositions makes my art..... throw in negative space, color (patina) and 3 dimensional balance.. This is my art.
					</p>
					<p class="techniques__paragraph techniques__item">
						My metal art was first about making (raising) form from flat sheet. Necked in vessels that end up over sensual form. For metal to begin flat and to be able to be stretched and contracted into closed form with a hammer is amazing.
					</p>
					<p class="techniques__paragraph techniques__item">
						After this extreme raising of necked-in vessels comes those forms which pull back from the extreme and become more open and maybe more visually descriptive. Still about single piece. Exploring the bowl.
					</p>
					<p class="techniques__paragraph techniques__item">
						Then come the combinations of individual hammered pieces that are twisted and/or trapped together ( never welded or soldered ) or just placed in and on or next to each other to make images and visual statements. Single pieces together, no welding or soldering. These become organic sculptures of nests, companions, offerings, vessels etc.
					</p>
					<p class="techniques__paragraph techniques__item">
						Through titles, I can help make my art be about my insights and thoughts. Environmental statements are often there, but so is the sensual.  I make them work together.
					</p>
					<p class="techniques__paragraph techniques__item">
						Functionality of the crafted vessel is here, they can hold water and objects.
					</p>
					<p class="techniques__paragraph techniques__item">
						I've been exploring the hammered form and the hammered line for almost 40 years. Still new things to find.
